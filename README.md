# CMM Prototype Implementation

This repository contains a minimal prototype implementation of **Computational Muscle Memory (CMM)**.

The goal of this codebase is not to provide a complete framework, but to demonstrate the core control-loop ideas described in the accompanying essay:
- experience logging
- pattern extraction
- reflex storage
- explicit override
- rollback on failure

The implementation is intentionally simple and deterministic, prioritizing clarity and inspectability over performance or generality.

## Status

This is an experimental prototype used to validate the conceptual design.  
Interfaces, structure, and behavior may change as the idea evolves.

## Related Work

The design and motivation behind this implementation are described in the essay:
